        <p>
          Hello there!!, I was born in Villavicencio, Colombia, but grew up
          living in the cities Manizales and Medell√≠n. My curiosity to
          understand how the world works led me to study chemical engineering, a
          career that taught me to view things from multiple perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          For over 8 years, I worked as a chemical engineer, specializing in
          water treatment and environmental technologies. This period gave me
          experience in leadership, project management, and complex
          problem-solving. I also ventured into various entrepreneurial
          projects, from craft brewing to environmental consulting. It was in
          the midst of these projects that I had my first encounters with
          programming. I used digital tools to solve problems in my work, which
          sparked my interest in technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coronavirus pandemic marked a turning point in my life. Amidst the
          uncertainty, I secured a scholarship offered by Globant and
          MercadoLibre to study software development. This opportunity allowed
          me to change course and immerse myself in the world of programming.
          Since then, I've worked on various development projects, from local
          startups to my current position as a full stack developer for an
          international company.
        </p>
        <p>
          This path has allowed me to combine my engineering experience with my
          new technology skills. Today, I find myself at an exciting point in my
          career, integrating my analytical engineering background with the
          creativity of software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          -- I'm ready to face new challenges and continue growing in the field
          of technology.
